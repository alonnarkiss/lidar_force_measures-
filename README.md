# lidar_force_measures-
this project should measurs the force from pucnh or kick

measures the force Hook’s law \n 
'F=x*K = delta-distance * const'

 the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance (x) scales linearly with respect to that distance—that is, F s = k x , where k is a constant factor characteristic of the spring
